# Solution Summary
## Problem Description
In this assignment we are tasked to do navigation of a wumpus cave with
a vaccum cleaner. There is a representation of the wumpus cave that is given
in a text file format like below 

````text
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXX  XXXXXXXXX
XXX XX   XXXXXXXXX
XX          XXXXXX
X X     P     XXXX
X           S XXXX
XX     XX     XXXX
XX     XXX P  XXXX
XXX X XXX     XXXX
XXXXX     XXXXXXXX
XXXXX  XXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
````
So above is the representation of the files given. Here 'X' means wall
empty space means the positions where the vacuum cleaner can move and 
P are teleportation Portals. There are only two portals in a given map.
